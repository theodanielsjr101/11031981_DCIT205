LEARNING EXPERIENCE<hr>

Throughout this project, I have gained valuable experience in:
1)HTML and CSS for building a responsive and visually appealing website.
2)Organizing and presenting information effectively.
3)Incorporating images and multimedia to enhance the user experience.
4)The importance of clear documentation and creating a professional README.

This project has not only allowed me to showcase my technical skills but also to reflect on the importance of effective communication in web development.
